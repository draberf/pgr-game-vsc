# PGR Game Demo

This demo was developed for the PGR course at the Faculty of Informatics, BUT.

It is written in C++ and utilizes OpenGL and GLSL to render a simplistic 3D platformer game. It has been developed and can be launched using Visual Studio. However, it hasn't been maintained since hand-in, and likely won't launch out-of-the-box.

Highlights include an OOP approach to building and traversing the scene graph, dynamic camera and cel-shading on the static player character.

Demo video of the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Z8M5EMgXuSs?si=9FzKL_fES3cuS2tD).
